## FRIENDS CHARACTER QUIZ ##

# BACKGROUND #
For our CFG Intro to Web Dev graduation project, we were tasked with building a website that used basic HTML and CSS, and which incorporated some user interactivity.

# HIGHLIGHTS # 
Our team hit on 'Friends' as a shared reference, so we built our website with that at its heart. We wanted to try out an image carousel, and within-page anchors, so a quiz felt like a possible format for that.

# LEARNING MOMENTS & IMPROVEMENTS TO IMPLEMENT #
We had also covered basic JavaScript in our course, though it was optional to include that as part of our project. Though we didn't incorporate any JS in this particular project, we can see now how it could be redesigned with JS to have greater interactivity. 

With additional project time, we would also lay it out differently, so that the carousel was more user-friendly - and so that the website as a whole (particularly the 'Contact Us' page) had more sophisticated UX.
